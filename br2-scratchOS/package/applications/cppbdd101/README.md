# cppbdd101

A simple template for a correct c++ project layout and tools for delivering good artifact trough good development practices. 
This using open sources tools ONLY

## [ Project Versioning &#9650;](#___top "click to go to top of document")
It's inspired by [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/), [GitVersion](https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
### Base agreements:
* The stable versions of the package **should be** are announced by the developer in **master** branches
* Unstable versions of the package **could be** auto computed by the git environment on CI server
* Development **should be** carried out within the framework of the [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/),
and package versions **should be** based on [![Semver](http://img.shields.io/SemVer/2.0.0.png)](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

As CI server can publish the package as _unstable_ (_prerelease_) and _stable_ version.
For definition to be performed correctly, it is necessary to observe **GitFlow** branching model.

* **master** - package version remains as is `X.Y.Z`
* **develop** - package version is `X.(Y+1).0-alpha.{commits}`
* **feature/*** - package version is `X.(Y+1).0-feature-{hash}.{commits}`
* **release/vX'.Y'.Z'** - package version is `X'.Y'.Z'-rc.{commits}`
* **hotfix/*** - package version is `X.Y.(Z+1)-beta.{commits}`

`X` - current major version declarate in package.json

`Y` - current minor version declarate in package.json

`Z` - current patch version declarate in package.json

`{hash}` - it's first feature branch commit (generic commit from develop and feature branch)

`{commits}` - quantity commits from branch start.

Prerelease path could be override with config file `git-semver-info.json`.
This config file should be place into **current work directory**.

Config file content (default value):

```json
{
  "prerelease": {
    "develop": "alpha.${developBranchCommitsCount}",
    "feature": "feature-${firstFeatureCommitSha}.${featureBranchCommitsCount}",
    "hotfix": "beta.${hotfixBranchCommitsCount}",
    "release": "rc.${releaseBranchCommitsCount}"
  }
}
```

### Example

The final semantic version of the package looks like:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<prerelease>+<build-number>
```
I.e For branch `feature/feature-name` and package version `1.2.3`,
it's prerelease version looks like:

```
1.2.3-feature-3kn3erb.13+42
```

| Distribution  Chanel | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| :bangbang: [__Nightly__](#www.tbd.acme) | Builds created out of the central repository every night, packaged up every night for bleeding-edge testers to install and test.These are not qualified by QA.                                                                                                      |
| :soon: [__Aurora__](#www.tbd.acme)  | Builds created out of the aurora repository, which is synced from central repository every weeks.There is a small amount of QA at the start of the 1 week period before the updates are offered.as such its status is roughly "experimental".  |
| :interrobang: [__Beta__](#www.tbd.acme)    | Builds created out of the master repository, qualified by QA as being of sufficient quality to release to beta users.                                                                         |
| :heavy_check_mark: [__Release__](#www.tbd.acme) | Builds created out of the release repository, qualified by QA as being of sufficient quality to release to hundreds of millions of people.                                                    |
